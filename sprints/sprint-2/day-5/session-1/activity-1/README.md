# First Challenge (Individual)

NOTE: Codebase is the Sprint 2 / DAY 5

You are the new developer for the company ACME. They've assigned you to work on their contact list application, which was created a long time ago and doesn't follow modern JavaScript best practices. The codebase is full of spaghetti codeâ€”functions and logic scattered across the application with little structure, making it difficult to maintain and extend.

Your primary task is to refactor this contact list application by applying modular JavaScript principles, improving readability, and organizing the code in a way that follows current best practices. You'll break down large functions into smaller, reusable pieces, replace outdated JavaScript features with modern ES6+ syntax, and ensure the code is more maintainable for future developers.

## Additional Task: Implement a Filter Feature

In addition to refactoring, you will need to implement a filter feature that allows users to search and filter through the contact list based on name, email, or phone number. This feature should be efficient and integrate seamlessly with the newly refactored codebase.

## Objectives:

Analyze the current codebase and identify areas that need improvement.
Refactor the code using modules, separating concerns logically.
Replace var with let/const, use arrow functions, template literals, and other modern JavaScript features.
Implement the filter functionality to search contacts dynamically as the user types.
Ensure the application maintains its current functionality after refactoring.
Write comments where necessary to explain complex sections of code.
